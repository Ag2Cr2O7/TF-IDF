Marxism is our fundamental guiding ideology for building the Party and the country. Our experience has taught us that, at the fundamental level, we owe the success of the Communist Party of China and socialism with Chinese characteristics to the fact that Marxism works, particularly when it is adapted to the Chinese context and the needs of our times Having the guidance of Marxist scientific theory is the basis for our Party to strengthen its faith and grasp the historical initiative.
Promoting the modernization of Marxism in China is a process of pursuing truth, revealing truth and practicing truth. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the new changes in the domestic and international situation and the new requirements of practice have made it urgent for us to thoroughly answer a series of major issues of the times related to the development of the cause of the Party and the country and the governance of the country by the Party from the perspective of theory and practice. Our Party has the courage to conduct theoretical exploration and innovation, deepen its understanding of the ruling law of the Communist Party, the law of socialist construction, and the law of human society development from a new perspective, and have made major theoretical innovations, which are embodied in the socialist thought with Chinese characteristics for a new era. The "Ten Clarifications", "Fourteen Adherences" and "Thirteen Achievements" proposed at the 19th National Congress and the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee summarize the main contents of this thought, which must be adhered to and constantly enriched and developed for a long time.
The people of the CPC have deeply realized that only by combining the basic principles of Marxism with China's specific reality, with China's excellent traditional culture, and adhering to the application of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, can we correctly answer the major questions raised by the times and practice, and can we always maintain the vitality and exuberance of Marxism.
Adherence to and development of Marxism must be combined with China's specific realities. We adhere to the guidance of Marxism to solve China's problems with its scientific world outlook and methodology, rather than recite and repeat its specific conclusions and words, let alone regard Marxism as an unchanging dogma. We must adhere to emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, advancing with the times, seeking truth and pragmatism, proceed from reality in everything, focus on solving the practical problems of reform, opening up and socialist modernization in the new era, constantly answer the questions of China, the world, the people and the times, make correct answers that meet China's reality and the requirements of the times, draw scientific understanding that conforms to objective laws, and form theoretical achievements that advance with the times, Better guide China's practice.
Adherence to and development of Marxism must be combined with the excellent traditional Chinese culture. Only by taking root in the rich soil of our own country and national history and culture can the tree of Marxist truth take root. The excellent traditional Chinese culture has a long history, is broad and profound, and is the crystallization of the wisdom of Chinese civilization. It contains the ideas that the world is for the public, the people are the foundation of the country, the government is based on virtue, the reform of the old and the reform of the new, the appointment of people on their merits, the unity of heaven and man, self-improvement, virtue, good faith, amity, and kindness to neighbors. It is an important embodiment of the Chinese people's outlook on the universe, the world, society, and morality accumulated in their long-term production and life, It is highly consistent with the scientific socialist values. We must be confident in history and culture, adhere to the principle of making the past serve the present and bring forth the new, connect the essence of Marxist thought with the essence of Chinese excellent traditional culture, and integrate with the common values that the people use everyday without being aware of, constantly endow scientific theories with bright Chinese characteristics, and constantly consolidate the historical and mass basis of Marxism's localization in China, so that Marxism can firmly take root in China.
There is no end to practice and theoretical innovation. It is the solemn historical responsibility of the contemporary CPC people to constantly write a new chapter of the sinicization and modernization of Marxism. To continue to promote theoretical innovation on the basis of practice, first of all, we should grasp the world outlook and methodology of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and adhere to and use the positions, viewpoints and methods that run through them.
We must put the people first. The nature of the people is the essential attribute of Marxism. The Party's theory comes from, for and benefits the people. The people's creative practice is the inexhaustible source of theoretical innovation. All theories that are divorced from the people are powerless, and all theories that do not benefit the people are lifeless. We should stand firm in the people's position, grasp their wishes, respect their creativity, and concentrate their wisdom, so as to form a theory that is loved, recognized, and owned by the people, and make it a powerful ideological weapon to guide the people to understand and transform the world.
We must adhere to self-confidence and self-reliance. The bright prospect for the Chinese people and the Chinese nation to move from the deep suffering of modern times to the great rejuvenation has never been a textbook, let alone a ready answer. The successful path of the Party's centennial struggle was pioneered by the Party's leadership and the people's independent exploration. The Chinese chapter of Marxism was put into practice by the CPC people relying on their own strength. One of the basic points running through it is that China's problems must proceed from China's basic national conditions and be answered by the Chinese themselves. We should adhere to a firm belief in Marxism and socialism with Chinese characteristics, be confident in our path, theory, system and culture, and make new contributions to the development of Marxism with a more positive spirit of historical responsibility and creativity. We should neither seek victory in times of adversity, be closed and rigid, nor copy and copy foreign countries.
We must keep the world in mind. The CPC is a party that seeks happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation. It is also a party that seeks progress for mankind and common ground for the world. We should broaden our world vision, have a deep insight into the trend of human development and progress, actively respond to the common concerns of people all over the world, make contributions to solving common problems facing mankind, draw on and absorb all the outstanding achievements of human civilization with a broad mind that embraces all rivers, and promote the building of a better world.
3„ÄÅ The mission and task of the CPC in the new era and new journey
From this day forward, the central task of the CPC will be to lead the Chinese people of all ethnic groups in a concerted effort to realize the Second Centenary Goal of building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects and to advance the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization.
On the basis of long-term exploration and practice since the founding of New China, especially since the reform and opening up, and through innovative breakthroughs in theory and practice since the 18th National Congress, our party has successfully promoted and expanded Chinese path to modernization.
Chinese path to modernization is a socialist modernization led by the CPC. It has the common characteristics of modernization in all countries, as well as Chinese characteristics based on its own national conditions.
Chinese path to modernization is a modernization with a huge population. China's population of more than 1.4 billion has marched into a modern society as a whole, which is larger than the total population of the existing developed countries. It is unprecedented in difficulty and complexity. The way of development and promotion must also have its own characteristics. We have always considered problems, made decisions and handled affairs in the light of our national conditions. We are neither ambitious nor conservative. We have maintained historical patience, and we have continued to make progress while maintaining stability.
Chinese path to modernization is the modernization of common prosperity for all people. Common prosperity is the essential requirement of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and it is also a long-term historical process. We adhere to the realization of the people's aspiration for a better life as the starting point and end result of the modernization drive, strive to safeguard and promote social fairness and justice, strive to promote common prosperity for all people, and resolutely prevent polarization.
Chinese path to modernization is a kind of modernization in which material civilization and spiritual civilization are coordinated. Abundance in material and spirit is the fundamental requirement of socialist modernization. Material poverty is not socialism, nor is spiritual poverty socialism. We continue to lay a solid material foundation for modernization and consolidate the material conditions for people's happy lives. At the same time, we vigorously develop advanced socialist culture, strengthen education in ideals and beliefs, inherit Chinese civilization, and promote the all-round enrichment of things and the all-round development of people.
Chinese path to modernization is a kind of modernization in which man and nature coexist harmoniously. Man and nature are a community of life. Endless demands and even destruction of nature will inevitably be retaliated by nature. We adhere to sustainable development, adhere to the principle of giving priority to conservation, protection and natural recovery, protect the natural and ecological environment as well as protect the eyes, and unswervingly follow the path of civilized development featuring development in production, prosperity and good ecology, so as to realize the sustainable development of the Chinese nation.
Chinese path to modernization is a modernization that follows the path of peaceful development. China does not follow the old path of some countries to achieve modernization through war, colonialism, plunder and other means. The old path of profiting at the expense of others and full of bloody crimes has brought heavy suffering to the people of developing countries. We firmly stand on the right side of history and the progress of human civilization, hold high the banner of peace, development, cooperation and win-win results, seek our own development while firmly safeguarding world peace and development, and better safeguard world peace and development with our own development.
The essential requirements of Chinese modernization are as follows: upholding the leadership of the Communist Party of China and socialism with Chinese characteristics, pursuing high-quality development, developing whole-process people's democracy, enriching the people's cultural lives, achieving common prosperity for all, promoting harmony between humanity and nature, building a human community with a shared future, and creating a new form of human advancement.
To build China into a powerful socialist modernization country in an all-round way, the overall strategic arrangement is to take two steps: to basically achieve socialist modernization from 2020 to 2035; From 2035 to the middle of this century, we will build China into a strong, prosperous, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful modern socialist country.
By 2035, the overall goal of China's development is to achieve a significant leap in economic strength, scientific and technological strength and comprehensive national strength, and to step up the per capita GDP to a new level and reach the level of moderately developed countries; Achieve self-reliance in high-level science and technology, and enter the forefront of innovative countries; Build a modern economic system, form a new pattern of development, and basically realize new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization; We will basically modernize the country's governance system and capacity, improve the people's democratic system throughout the process, and basically build a country, government, and society under the rule of law; Build China into a strong country in education, science and technology, talent, culture, sports and health, and significantly enhance its cultural soft power; The people's lives will be happier and better, the per capita disposable income of residents will reach a new level, the proportion of middle-income groups will increase significantly, basic public services will be equalized, rural areas will basically have modern living conditions, society will remain stable for a long time, and people's all-round development and common prosperity will make more significant substantive progress; A green production and living style has been widely formed. After reaching the peak, carbon emissions have been stable and declined, the ecological environment has been fundamentally improved, and the goal of a beautiful China has been basically achieved; The national security system and capabilities were strengthened in an all-round way, and the modernization of national defense and the armed forces was basically achieved.
On the basis of basically realizing modernization, we should continue to strive to build China into a modern socialist power with leading comprehensive national strength and international influence by the middle of this century.
The next five years will be a critical period for the beginning of building a socialist modern country in an all-round way. The main goals and tasks are: making new breakthroughs in high-quality economic development, significantly improving the ability of science and technology to stand on its own, and making significant progress in building a new development pattern and a modern economic system; New steps have been taken in reform and opening up, the modernization of the country's governance system and capacity has been further advanced, the socialist market economic system has been improved, and a new system of open economy with a higher level has basically taken shape; Throughout the process, people's democracy has been institutionalized, standardized and procedural, and the socialist system of rule of law with Chinese characteristics has been improved; The people's spiritual and cultural life has become more abundant, and the cohesion of the Chinese nation and the influence of Chinese culture have been growing; The growth of residents' income and economic growth are basically synchronized, the improvement of labor remuneration and labor productivity are basically synchronized, the level of equalization of basic public services is significantly improved, and the multi-level social security system is more sound; The urban and rural living environment has improved significantly, and the construction of a beautiful China has achieved remarkable results; The national security has been further consolidated, the centenary goal of building the military has been achieved as scheduled, and the construction of a safe China has been steadily promoted; China's international status and influence have been further enhanced, and China will play a greater role in global governance.
Building a modern socialist country in an all-round way is a great and arduous undertaking with a bright future and a long way to go. At present, the unprecedented changes in the world have accelerated their evolution, a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation has developed in depth, and the balance of international forces has been profoundly adjusted. China faces new strategic opportunities for development. At the same time, the epidemic situation in the 21st century has had a profound impact. The trend of anti globalization has risen, unilateralism and protectionism have risen significantly, the world economy has not recovered effectively, local conflicts and turbulence have occurred frequently, global problems have intensified, and the world has entered a new period of turbulence and change. China's reform, development and stability are faced with many deep-seated contradictions that cannot be avoided. Party building, especially the building of a clean and honest government and the fight against corruption, are faced with many stubborn and recurrent problems. External repression and containment may escalate at any time. China's development has entered a period in which strategic opportunities and risks coexist and uncertain and unpredictable factors increase. Various "black swan" and "grey rhino" events may occur at any time. We must be more mindful of potential dangers, be prepared to deal with worst-case scenarios, and be ready to withstand high winds, choppy waters, and even dangerous storms. On the journey ahead, we must firmly adhere to the following major principles.
